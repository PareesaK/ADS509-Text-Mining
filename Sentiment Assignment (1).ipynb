    "A: <!-- Your answer here --> Artist Cher top songs are love and understanding, i found you love and perfection, while her bottom songs are bangbang, outrageous and i walk on guilded splinters. Robyn top songs are we dance to the beat 114528, we dance to the beat and love is free. Robyn bottom songs are don't fucking tell me what to do, criminal intent and don't fucking tell me what to do 114520. The sentiment score is driven by the emotional tone and word choices in the lyrics. Songs with high sentiment scores likely contain positive words related to love, happiness, and hope, while lower sentiment scores are influenced by themes of sadness, heartbreak, loss and cursing. \n",
